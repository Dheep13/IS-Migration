This integration flow retrieves product details from an SAP HANA database using OData services. It validates product identifiers against a predefined list, fetches detailed product information for valid IDs, and returns appropriate error messages for invalid product requests. The flow includes validation logic through Groovy scripts and property enrichers to ensure data integrity.
