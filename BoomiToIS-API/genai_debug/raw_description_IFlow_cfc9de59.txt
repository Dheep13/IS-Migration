This iFlow manages investment accounts through multiple endpoints: creating accounts with beneficiaries, updating/deleting beneficiaries, retrieving account details, initiating/canceling payment orders, retrieving filtered payment orders, processing ACATS and RMD transactions, and updating customer profiles. It uses enrichers, Groovy scripts, OData calls, and request-reply components to handle financial transactions with proper ID generation and response formatting.
