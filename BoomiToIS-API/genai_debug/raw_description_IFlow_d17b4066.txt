This iFlow receives webhook notifications from Stripe when new subscriptions are created, processes the data through an enricher to set dynamic properties, transforms the subscription data to Salesforce Opportunity format using a Groovy script, and creates a new Opportunity in Salesforce. It includes error handling that formats error messages and sends email notifications when issues occur.
