This iFlow processes Stripe subscription webhook events by extracting customer and product data, retrieving additional information from Stripe APIs, and creating corresponding Salesforce Opportunities. It includes error handling for notifications and specifically handles the 'customer.subscription.created' event type, transforming the data through multiple enrichers and a Groovy script before posting to Salesforce.
