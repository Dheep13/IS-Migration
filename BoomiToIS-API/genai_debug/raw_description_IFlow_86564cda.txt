This iFlow retrieves detailed product information via an OData service. It validates product identifiers against a predefined list, constructs appropriate OData query parameters, fetches product details from a HANA database, and handles error responses when products aren't found. The flow includes validation logic through Groovy scripts and content enrichers to ensure proper request processing and response formatting.
