This integration flow retrieves user contact information from SuccessFactors via OData, transforms the data using a Groovy script, and uploads it to an SFTP server with a timestamped filename. It includes error handling with email notifications and logging. The flow processes contact details into a structured format with batch processing directives and contact lists before secure transfer.
