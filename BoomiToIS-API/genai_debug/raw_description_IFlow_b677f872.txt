This iFlow receives Stripe subscription webhook notifications, validates the signature, transforms the subscription data, and creates corresponding Salesforce Opportunities. It processes the JSON payload, extracts subscription details, converts them to the Salesforce Opportunity format, and sends the data to Salesforce using authenticated API calls, returning appropriate status responses.
