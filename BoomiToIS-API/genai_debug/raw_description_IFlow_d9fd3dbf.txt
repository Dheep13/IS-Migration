This integration flow retrieves employee data from SuccessFactors via OData API, validates the data structure, transforms it into a structured format, and uploads it to an SFTP server. It supports both GET operations to fetch employee information and PUT operations to directly write processed data to the SFTP location. The flow includes logging for successful processing and error handling for data validation failures.
