This iFlow retrieves contact information from SuccessFactors via OData, validates the data structure, transforms it to Kafka Avro format, and uploads it to an SFTP server. It includes error handling with email notifications and comprehensive logging. The process branches based on data validation results, either proceeding with the transformation and upload or triggering the error subprocess.
