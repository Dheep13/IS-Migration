This iFlow retrieves product details from SAP HANA via OData based on a product identifier provided as a query parameter. It validates the product ID against a list of known identifiers, fetches the matching product data with detailed attributes, and formats the response appropriately. If the product doesn't exist, it returns a standardized error message with code PRODUCT_NOT_FOUND.
