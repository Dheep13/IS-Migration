## Troubleshooting
If the iFlow is not visible in SAP Integration Suite after import:
1. Check that all OData participants have type="EndpointReceiver"
2. Verify that message flows connect service tasks to participants
3. Ensure all components have corresponding BPMNShape elements
4. Confirm that all connections have corresponding BPMNEdge elements
