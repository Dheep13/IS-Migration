This integration flow extracts employee data from SuccessFactors via a GET request to the /EmployeeData endpoint, validates the structure and content, transforms the data using predefined mappings, and uploads it to an SFTP server with a date-stamped filename. Error handling includes email notifications to administrators with detailed error messages. The flow supports batch processing with specific mapping directives for account IDs, contact information, and processing options.
