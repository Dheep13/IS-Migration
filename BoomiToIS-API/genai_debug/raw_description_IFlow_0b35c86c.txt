This integration flow receives Stripe subscription webhook events, verifies the signature, transforms the JSON payload to XML, and creates corresponding Salesforce Opportunities. It extracts subscription details, converts them to Salesforce-compatible format, and sends the data to Salesforce using authenticated REST API calls, enabling automated opportunity creation when subscription events occur.
