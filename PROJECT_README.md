# MuleSoft to SAP Integration Suite Converter

## Overview

The MuleSoft to SAP Integration Suite Converter is an innovative tool designed to bridge the gap between MuleSoft applications and SAP Integration Suite. This project leverages advanced AI models to analyze MuleSoft applications and generate equivalent SAP Integration Suite implementations, significantly reducing the time and effort required for migration or cross-platform integration.

> **Note:** This project is in early stages of development. The AI models are continuously being trained and improved based on user feedback and additional data.

## Key Features

### Documentation Generation
- Automatically analyzes MuleSoft code to generate comprehensive documentation
- Creates detailed Markdown documentation with flow diagrams
- Identifies key components, endpoints, and data transformations

### SAP Integration Suite Equivalents
- Identifies matching patterns and components in SAP Integration Suite
- Suggests equivalent implementations for MuleSoft components
- Provides references to SAP Integration Suite documentation and examples

### iFlow Generation
- Automatically generates SAP Integration Suite iFlow implementations
- Creates deployable iFlow packages (.zip files)
- Maintains the core functionality of the original MuleSoft application

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js with modern UI components
- **Backend**: Python Flask APIs
- **AI Engine**: Custom-trained open source models for code analysis and generation
- **Integration**: Direct connectivity with SAP BTP Integration Suite (optional)

## How It Works

1. **Upload MuleSoft Code**: Users upload their MuleSoft application code through the web interface
2. **Documentation Generation**: The system analyzes the code and generates comprehensive documentation
3. **SAP Equivalents**: The AI engine identifies equivalent SAP Integration Suite components and patterns
4. **iFlow Generation**: Based on the analysis, the system generates deployable SAP Integration Suite iFlow packages

## Architecture

The application consists of three main components:

1. **Frontend Application**: Web interface for user interaction
2. **Main API Server**: Handles documentation generation and SAP equivalents identification
3. **iFlow Generation API**: Specialized service for creating SAP Integration Suite iFlow packages

These components work together to provide a seamless experience while maintaining separation of concerns for better scalability and maintenance.

## AI Model Information

The system uses custom-trained open source models that have been specifically fine-tuned for:

- MuleSoft code analysis and understanding
- SAP Integration Suite pattern recognition
- iFlow generation based on functional requirements

Our models are continuously improved through:
- Feedback loops from user interactions
- Additional training data from successful migrations
- Expert review of generated outputs

> **Note:** The specific model architecture and training methodologies are proprietary.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 14+
- Git
- GitHub Personal Access Token (for SAP Integration patterns repository access)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/your-organization/mulesoft-to-sap-converter.git
cd mulesoft-to-sap-converter
```

2. Set up the backend
```
cd app
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

3. Set up the iFlow generation API
```
cd ../MuleToIS-API
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

4. Set up the frontend
```
cd ../IFA-Project/frontend
npm install
```

### Running the Application

1. Start the main API server
```
cd app
python app.py
```

2. Start the iFlow generation API server
```
cd MuleToIS-API
python app.py
```

3. Start the frontend development server
```
cd IFA-Project/frontend
npm run dev
```

4. Access the application at http://localhost:5173

## Current Limitations

- The AI models are in early stages and may not handle all complex MuleSoft patterns
- Some specialized MuleSoft connectors may not have direct SAP Integration Suite equivalents
- Performance optimization for large applications is ongoing
- The generated iFlows may require manual adjustments for production use

## Roadmap

- Enhanced pattern recognition for complex MuleSoft applications
- Direct deployment to SAP BTP Integration Suite
- Batch processing for multiple applications
- Improved visualization of mapping between MuleSoft and SAP components
- Support for additional MuleSoft connectors and patterns
