SimpleProductAPI provides a RESTful interface for product data management with two endpoints: GET /products retrieves a list of all products with basic details, and GET /products/{id} fetches comprehensive information for a specific product. Both endpoints connect to an OData service, process the data through Groovy scripts for logging and transformation, and return standardized JSON responses with appropriate headers.
